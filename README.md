# Projekt JA
This repository contains all project files used and created by the team consisting of Martyna Sadowska, Hanna Szczerbi≈Ñska, and Ada Wojterska, in connection with our 2nd project in the course 'Data Visualization Techniques' at Warsaw University of Technology, during the 2024/2025 winter semester. We created a Shiny dashboard that shows the different ways we spend time, focusing mostly on the educational activities. 

The whole app is divided into 3 sections: Overview, which shows the big picture of how much time uni work takes us, Studying, which dives deeper into the specific people, subjects, and days when we learn, and Leisure, which completes the story by talking about our free-time pursuits; each of them contains multiple interactive charts and visualisations focusing on different aspects of the section's theme.

The data for this project was gathered individually by every person participating, from 05.12.2024 to 19.01.2025. 

While it's always better to run the app locally (as it minimizes the likelihood of various hosting server errors - such as one of the charts not working in the online version while working fine locally), here we do also post a link to an online version of the complete dashboard: https://adawojterska.shinyapps.io/twdprojekt2/
